This documentation describes the the available endpoints of the Vehicle Service API and how to interact
with them.

== Get all vehicles of a manufacturer

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `GET /vehicle/{manufacturerId}/vehicles`

The API requires an existing manufacturer ID in the request path for which all the currently stored vehicles
will be returned. Note that this endpoint supports streaming, this means you may call it with one of the following
accept headers:

* `text/event-stream`
* `application/stream+json`

Example request for getting all vehicles of BMW using the latter header:
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-valid/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-valid/path-parameters.adoc[]

HTTP response:
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-valid/http-response.adoc[]

The above example response returns a stream of three vehicles. Each json can be de-serialized into a valid
`Vehicle` object:
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-valid/response-fields.adoc[]

In case the `manufacturerId` is invalid (i.e. there is no manufacturer with that particular ID), an error message will
be returned. Request:
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-invalid/http-request.adoc[]

Response:
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-invalid/http-response.adoc[]

Field description:
include::{snippets}/manufacturer-vehicles-invalid/response-fields.adoc[]

== Registering a new vehicle

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `POST /vehicle/{manufacturerId}`

An existing manufacturer is able to register new vehicles through this endpoint. The request body must contain the
valid vehicle json that should be stored in the database.

[NOTE]
Since a vehicle's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is world-wide unique, only vehicles that are not aready in the
database can be added.

The following snippet shows an example of registering a new BMW vehicle:
include::{snippets}/add-new-vehicle-valid/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-new-vehicle-valid/request-fields.adoc[]

If the insertion was successful, the response contains the registered and therefore same vehicle:
include::{snippets}/add-new-vehicle-valid/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/add-new-vehicle-valid/response-fields.adoc[]

In case the provided vehicle is already in the database, the API returns an appropriate error message.
Inserting an already existing vehicle:
include::{snippets}/add-new-vehicle-invalid/http-request.adoc[]
Response:
include::{snippets}/add-new-vehicle-invalid/http-response.adoc[]

== Get all vehicles

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `GET /vehicle/vehicles`

This endpoint simply returns a stream of all stored vehicles and should only be invoked by other services that have privilege to do so.
Note that this endpoint supports streaming, this means you may call it with one of the following
accept headers:

* `text/event-stream`
* `application/stream+json`

Example request for getting all vehicles using the latter header:
include::{snippets}/all-vehicles/http-request.adoc[]

HTTP response:
include::{snippets}/all-vehicles/http-response.adoc[]

The above example response returns a stream of 6 different vehicles. Each json can be de-serialized into a valid
`Vehicle` object:
include::{snippets}/all-vehicles/response-fields.adoc[]
