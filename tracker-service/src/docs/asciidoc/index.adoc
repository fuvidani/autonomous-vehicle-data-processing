This documentation describes the the available endpoints of the Tracker Service API and how to interact
with them.

== Live-stream vehicles' data of a manufacturer

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `GET /tracking/manufacturer/{manufacturerId}`

Tha API requires an existing manufacturer ID in the request path for which vehicle data records will be streamed down whenever available.
Not that this is indeed a hot stream, i.e. the sequence of how data arrives is not determined and depends on the live traffic.
You may invoke this endpoint with one of these headers:

* `text/event-stream`
* `application/stream+json`

Example request for getting the stream for Tesla using the latter header:
include::{snippets}/tracking-stream-tesla/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/tracking-stream-tesla/path-parameters.adoc[]

HTTP response:
include::{snippets}/tracking-stream-tesla/http-response.adoc[]

The above example response returns a stream of three vehicle data records with a ping data record at the beginning. The ping data is only
sent once at the very beginning in order to keep the connection alive. Clients should simply ignore this first record. Each json can be de-serialized into a valid
object:
include::{snippets}/tracking-stream-tesla/response-fields.adoc[]

Important: This endpoint will never close its end, meaning it's the client's responsibility to unsubscribe from the stream if
they aren't interested anymore.

== Get all stored vehicle data record of a manufacturer

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `GET /tracking/history/manufacturer/{manufacturerId}`

Tha API requires an existing manufacturer ID in the request path for which all the currently stored vehicle data
records will be returned. In other words, the client will receive the history (every data record up to this point) of their
vehicle's records. Note that this endpoint supports streaming, this means you may call it with one of the following
accept headers:

* `text/event-stream`
* `application/stream+json`

Example request for getting all the vehicle data records of Audi using the latter header:
include::{snippets}/tracking-history-audi/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/tracking-history-audi/path-parameters.adoc[]

HTTP response:
include::{snippets}/tracking-history-audi/http-response.adoc[]

The above example response returns a stream of three vehicle data records. Each json can be de-serialized into a valid
object:
include::{snippets}/tracking-history-audi/response-fields.adoc[]
