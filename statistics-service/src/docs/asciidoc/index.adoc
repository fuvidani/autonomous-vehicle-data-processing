This documentation describes the the available endpoints of the Statistics Service API and how to interact
with them.

== Live-stream and history accident reports

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `GET /statistics/accidents`

The API returns a stream of all history accident reports and it stays open for streaming newly added reports as well. Note that this is indeed a hot stream, i.e. the sequence of how data arrives is not determined and depends on the live traffic.

You may invoke this endpoint with one of these headers:

* `text/event-stream`
* `application/stream+json`

Example request for getting the stream using the latter header:
include::{snippets}/accident-report-stream/http-request.adoc[]

HTTP response:
include::{snippets}/accident-report-stream/http-response.adoc[]

The above example response returns a stream of two accident reports. Each json can be de-serialized into a valid
object:
include::{snippets}/accident-report-stream/response-fields.adoc[]

Important: This endpoint will never close its end, meaning it's the client's responsibility to unsubscribe from the stream if
they aren't interested anymore.
