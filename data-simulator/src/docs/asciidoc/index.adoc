This documentation describes the the available endpoints of the Data Simulator API and how to interact
with them. **This API is meant only for presentation purposes. In a real-world scenario, operations offered
by the data simulator would go through the message broker dispatched by vehicles on the street.**

== Update emergency service's status of an accident

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `POST /datasimulation/updatestatus`

This endpoint expects a valid `EmergencyServiceMessage` object in the body, which contains the time of happening, the
ID of the accident and the status of the service. The simulation of the event is handled asynchronously,
such that the endpoint will return "OK".

Sample HTTP request:
include::{snippets}/ems-update-status/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/ems-update-status/request-fields.adoc[]

In case the provided body is invalid, the endpoint will return `400 BAD REQUEST`.

== Simulate a near crash event

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `POST /datasimulation/simulatenearcrash`

The client may simply send a POST request to the endpoint above. The simulation of the event is handled asynchronously,
such that the endpoint will return "OK".

Sample HTTP request:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
POST /datasimulation/simulatenearcrash HTTP/1.1
Host: data-simulator.com
Content-Length: 0
----

Sample HTTP response:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 4

"OK"
----

== Simulate a crash event

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `POST /datasimulation/simulatecrash`

The client may simply send a POST request to the endpoint above. The simulation of the event is handled asynchronously,
such that the endpoint will return "OK".

Sample HTTP request:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
POST /datasimulation/simulatecrash HTTP/1.1
Host: data-simulator.com
Content-Length: 0
----

Sample HTTP response:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 4

"OK"

== Reset simulation

[NOTE]
Endpoint: `POST /datasimulation/reset`

The client may simply send a POST request to the endpoint above. This operation causes the on-going (or finished) simualation
to start over.

Sample HTTP request:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
POST /datasimulation/reset HTTP/1.1
Host: data-simulator.com
Content-Length: 0
----

Sample HTTP response:
[source,http,options="nowrap"]

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
